# --- Optional: Set a default target environment ---
# This is intended for local development to prevent users from accidentally applying plans to the prod environment.
# It is a development only config and should NOT be committed to your git repo.
# https://sqlmesh.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/configuration/#default-target-environment

# Uncomment the following line to use a default target environment derived from the logged in user's name.
default_target_environment: dev_{{ user() }}

# Example usage:
# sqlmesh plan            # Automatically resolves to: sqlmesh plan dev_yourname
# sqlmesh plan prod       # Specify `prod` to apply changes to production
